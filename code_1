Risk Description

Script failures if Python references are not updated properly.

OBIEE report connection issues after switching to DR.

Scheduling conflicts due to manual statement timing changes.

Data mismatch or file errors from Logic 69 or NBSP fixes.

Archival or validation failures in APAC GIN updates.

Missing data in BAD Value Report after logic update.

Job execution delays from Frontier configuration changes.

Risk Mitigation Plan

Perform full regression testing in CERT before deployment.

Validate OBIEE DR connectivity and report generation.

Confirm schedule changes with upstream/downstream teams.

Test Informatica changes and verify file outputs.

Validate report logic and archival paths post-deployment.

Review Frontier job execution timing after go-live.

Keep rollback plan and backups ready for quick restoration.

































Objective

Upgrade all scripts and references to Python 3.11.11 under Phase 2 to ensure compatibility, stability, and compliance.

Reconfigure OBIEE Cert Report to connect to the DR database for improved resiliency.

Update DR APAC Manual Statement schedule timing as per upstream requirements.

Implement Logic 69 change, NBSP fix, and APAC GIN archival updates in DFR APAC Informatica.

Enhance DR BAD Value Report to retrieve only recent items.

Apply Frontier configuration and scheduling updates as part of DR APAC Phase 2 rollout.

Rationale

Ensures environment consistency and long-term support with Python 3.11.11 upgrade.

Improves disaster recovery readiness by directing OBIEE reporting to DR.

Optimizes batch processing efficiency by adjusting the APAC schedule timing.

Enhances data accuracy and integrity through Logic 69 and NBSP fixes.

Streamlines report performance by limiting output to relevant and recent records.

Aligns Frontier configurations with Phase 2 implementation standards.

Outcome

All applications and scripts execute successfully under Python 3.11.11.

OBIEE reports generate correctly from the DR environment.

APAC schedules run at revised timings with no dependency conflicts.

DFR APAC Informatica processes produce accurate and validated outputs.

BAD Value Report reflects only recent data, improving clarity and performance.

Frontier updates and configurations are successfully deployed and validated.

Overall system reliability, maintainability, and process efficiency are improved post-deployment.
