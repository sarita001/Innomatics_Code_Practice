date population for ISBC and CIB024 files, enhance data security and compliance, standardize CERT workflows, improve reporting consistency, and prepare foundational architecture for future system migrations and reporting needs.

Rationale
	•	Late file arrivals result in incorrect date population when system date is used.
	•	Audit reviews require removal of sensitive credit card information from descriptive text.
	•	Inactive scheduler reports contain invalid entries impacting report accuracy.
	•	Future migration of Fed R3XP processing requires staging tables in Informatica.
	•	Admin name inconsistencies across databases impact CERT workflow standardization.
	•	Lack of visibility into unmapped DDA records limits reporting capabilities.
	•	Missing Account Name in output files reduces clarity for downstream users.
	•	Regional DFR reports lack consistency, leading to reconciliation inefficiencies.

Outcome
	•	ISBC and CIB024 files populate accurate dates using header information.
	•	Sensitive credit card data is filtered, ensuring audit compliance.
	•	Scheduler reports reflect only valid inactive schedulers.
	•	R3XP staging tables provide a scalable foundation for future Informatica migration.
	•	CERT workflows use standardized admin naming and support upcoming Frontier versions.
	•	Unmapped DDA records are captured for future reporting and analysis.
	•	Output and update files include Account Name for improved usability.
	•	DFR reconciliation reports are standardized across APAC, EMEA, and LATAM.











Updating ISBC and CIB024 date derivation logic by reading the file header date and using it as the processing date to handle late file arrivals after midnight
	•	Implementing credit card number masking and filtering logic within FR3 GBS descriptive text fields to meet audit and confidentiality requirements
	•	Removing invalid scheduler ID 49 during inactive scheduler report generation by applying exclusion rules in report logic
	•	Building R3XP staging tables in Informatica to store intermediate data and support future migration from mainframe-based processing
	•	Enhancing CERT workflow mappings by including RecAdminFF in filter conditions to standardize admin naming across databases and support Frontier readiness
	•	Creating a Fed DDA table in Informatica to capture unmapped DDA records for future reporting and analysis
	•	Adding Account Name field to CERT workflow output file layouts to improve data clarity and downstream consumption
	•	Updating DFR reconciliation report logic for EMEA and LATAM regions to align structure and formatting with the APAC reports
	•	Extending account update file generation logic to include Account Name in the output records













Given ISBC/CIB024 processing, FR3 data handling, scheduler reporting, R3XP staging, CERT workflows, DDA processing, DFR reconciliation reporting, and account update f















rting, R3XP staging, CERT workflows, DDA processing, DFR reconciliation reporting, and account update file generation are executed, when the enhanced logic and mappings are applied, then file dates are derived from header dates, credit card data is filtered, invalid scheduler ID 49 is excluded, R3XP staging tables are populated, RecAdminFF is applied for admin standardization, unmapped DDA records are captured, EMEA/LATAM reports align with APAC, and Account Name is included in all relevant output files.
