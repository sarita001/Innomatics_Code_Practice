In the existing process, steganographic data is implemented directly within the blockchain network to ensure authenticity and data integrity. Blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-proof nature adds a layer of security to the hidden information, making it more resilient against unauthorized access or modification. This approach is particularly useful in applications like digital watermarking, where secure embedding of data is crucial.

However, the connection between image frames and the blockchain poses a potential vulnerability. While the steganographic data itself is secured within the blockchain, the process of linking or synchronizing the data with specific image frames can create weak points. These connection points, if not securely managed, may allow attackers to intercept or manipulate the frames before they are properly associated with the blockchain-stored data.

To address this, we can replicate the blockchain’s secure principles within the image frames themselves. In this approach, steganography is embedded directly into the frames using a process that mimics blockchain’s verification methods.
