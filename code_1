Coordinating parallel validations across regions (APAC, LATAM, EMEA) and DR environments required extensive effort.

Implementing holiday/weekend bundling for multiple feeds (FIRD, LIQ, Fed) introduced complex scheduling dependencies.

Ensuring functional parity while migrating legacy Python and mainframe processes into Informatica demanded detailed reconciliation and testing.







Executed ARC Switchover and Switchback for Frontier Finance with zero connectivity issues.

Deployed critical Informatica enhancements: CABL GIN rebuild, daily FIRD with holiday bundling, FED duplicate filtering, FX rate load update, and CERT user email automation.

Supported DFR APAC go-live with Subaccount Rule integration, config changes, and job deployments. Began parallel runs for BIFOUT (EMEA), CABLEIN (LATAM/APAC), and MFD (GCO).

Improved reporting and traceability via GCO unique identifiers, Fed code tables, and SQL views for Fed/TEBS reporting.

Advanced file transmission modernization: TRADS, SWIFT, GBS feeds for APAC Recon, FIRD via Informatica (CD Gateway decommission), and LIQ holiday bundling.

Strengthened security and access: Vault password rotations, new Frontier Company setup, reporting security groups, and enhanced notification coverage.Accomplishments (Q3)

Successfully executed the ARC Switchover and Switchback for Frontier Finance with no connectivity issues, ensuring production stability and disaster recovery readiness.

Deployed multiple Informatica enhancements including:

Rebuilt CABL GIN logic in Informatica and validated against Python output.

Enabled daily (7-day) FIRD processing with holiday/weekend bundling.

Implemented posting-date duplicate filtering in FED load process.

Updated FX rate load scheduling to run on the last calendar day.

Automated CERT user email notifications by migrating logic from Python to Informatica.

Developed an APS utility for SysUser status updates.

Enhanced reporting and traceability through:

Unique identifiers in GCO report.

New Informatica table for Fed code descriptions.

SQL view creation for Fed reporting and TEBS balances.

Advanced regional deployments:

DFR APAC go-live support with Subaccount Rule integration, config changes, and Informatica job deployments.

Began parallel processing for BIFOUT (EMEA), CABLEIN (LATAM/APAC), and MFD (GCO).

Improved file transmission and reconciliation:

Added TRADS, SWIFT, GBS feeds into APAC Recon.

Transmitted mainframe FIRD files via Informatica as part of CD Gateway decommissioning.

Implemented LIQ holiday bundling.

Strengthened security and compliance by rotating Vault passwords for Informatica and Certification DBs.

Expanded user access and communication by:

Creating new Frontier Company setup (accounts, jobs, passes).

Establishing security groups for reporting access.

Enhancing notifications (RSS mailbox, Frontier import completion alerts, DFR APAC distribution group).

Challenges Faced

Complex parallel validation efforts across DR GIN, APAC, LATAM, and DFR OBIEE required close coordination and extended testing cycles.

Managing holiday/weekend bundling logic for multiple feeds (FIRD, LIQ, Fed) introduced scheduling and sequencing dependencies.

Migration of legacy Python and mainframe processes into Informatica required detailed reconciliation to ensure functional parity.

Focus Areas for Rest of the Year

Complete regional Informatica parallel runs (DFR, CABLEIN, BIFOUT, MFD) and prepare for production cutovers.

Strengthen reconciliation automation and validation frameworks to reduce manual checks during feed bundling and file transmissions.

Progress on CD Gateway decommissioning and full transition of reporting/feeds to Informatica and SQL views.

Expand data enrichment and traceability capabilities across reports (e.g., GIN reference logic, write-off handling).

Continue security enhancements, including broader automation for credential rotations and scheduler monitoring.

Ensure post-DFR APAC go-live stabilization and extend support for additional processing cycles.
