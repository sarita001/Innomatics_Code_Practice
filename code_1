The objective of this release is to deliver Frontier BAU updates following the successful completion of the Frontier ARC failback exercise.

• Add a distribution group to the DFR APAC notification emails
• Update the EMEA CABLEIN field type in the DFR CABLEIN Python process to allow all potential characters
• Enhance DFR processes to support an additional cycle
• Run parallel validations for DFR GIN APAC LATAM and DFR OBIEE view updates
• Transmit mainframe FIRD files to Recon using Informatica
• Create an SQL view to support Fed reporting and replace the legacy mainframe output
• Enable password reset for the IIS server and IN UI tool to allow self-service account transfers for approvers
• Run primary production application, web, database, and MQ servers from the primary production environment
• Ensure no application connectivity issues when moving from contingency to production
• Validate production to function as usual after the failback activity
 All validations are successful and the systems run in production as expected











To conduct the ARC exercise for the Frontier Finance application by switching from the Production environment to the Frontier Disaster Recovery (DR) contingency environment. During this period, Production will be brought offline and the application will operate on contingency servers for 5 days until business validation is complete. After successful completion, the application will be switched back to the Production environment, thereby completing the ARC exercise.









GIVEN the ARC failover activity for the Frontier Finance application,
WHEN Production services are brought down and the application is switched over to the Disaster Recovery (DR) environment,
THEN users should be able to log in successfully to the DR environment, and business sign-off will be provided upon completion of the failover activity.











DFR APAC updates deployed to support regional go-live.
	•	Certification process enhanced for improved efficiency.
	•	Subaccount Rule integrated into daily file generation for accurate pre-assignment.
	•	Data retention and file transmission improvements implemented.
	•	Informatica DFR APAC jobs and batch processes successfully 	•	GIVEN the ARC failover exercise scheduled in September,
	•	WHEN the application is switched from Production to the Disaster Recovery (DR) contingency environment and the Production system is brought offline,
	•	THEN the application will run on contingency servers until business validations are successfully completed, after which it will be switched back to Production.















Added RSS mailbox for Certification scheduler failure notifications.
	•	Migrated maintenance deadline emails from Frontier to Informatica.
	•	Implemented MFTD, BIFOUT, and CABLEIN processes in Informatica with parallel runs.
	•	Created new Frontier company with accounts, jobs, and match passes.
	•	Enabled user notifications upon Frontier import completion.
	•	Integrated TRADS, SWIFT, and GBS files into APAC Recon.
	•	Updated logic to construct GIN references and include write-offs in matched groups.
	•	Built Informatica table for Federal Reserve code descriptions.
	•	Implemented Fed feed bundling for weekends/holidays and adjusted LIQ schedule for Christmas/New Year.
	•	Created security groups for reporting access and a view for TEBS balance reporting.
Implement DFR APAC enhancements in Informatica, Frontier, and OBIEE to automate access, streamline feed processing, and improve reconciliation and notifications in UAT and Production.

Rationale

These updates reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and enhance user experience. Automated OBIEE access ensures secure provisioning, reliable file processing supports financial integrity, and notifications give users visibility into reconciliation status.

Outcome

OBIEE provisions access for DFR APAC users via AD groups after scheduled batch runs.

GBS, TRADS, and SWIFT files are processed in Informatica, imported into Frontier NAS, and reconciled in DFR APAC.

Informatica processes IMSJ/P/M feeds and transmits outputs to NASPATH RECON without errors.

Users receive automated emails when the DFR APAC match process starts and completes.


Risk Description

Deployment of DFR APAC changes in Informatica, Frontier, and OBIEE may cause risks such as incorrect OBIEE access via AD groups, failures in processing GBS/TRADS/SWIFT/IMSJ-P-M feeds, missed Frontier notifications, or system instability, leading to access issues, data gaps, or reconciliation delays.

Risk Mitigation Plan

Validate AD groups and OBIEE access in UAT, cross-check Informatica outputs with Python, enable job/notification monitoring, retain backup files for reprocessing, communicate timelines to users, provide hypercare support, and keep rollback plans ready for quick recovery.
