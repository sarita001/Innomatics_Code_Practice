The proposed solution is built on a multi-layered architecture that brings blockchain-like security directly into image frames, eliminating the need for external blockchain linkage. Layer 1: Steganographic Embedding Layer embeds hidden payloads (e.g., watermarks, metadata) within the image frames using techniques like LSB, DWT, or DCT, ensuring minimal visual distortion. Layer 2: Hash Linking Layer implements a cryptographic hash chain, where each frame stores the hash of the previous frame, creating a tamper-evident chain similar to blockchain blocks. Layer 3: Metadata & Timestamp Layer adds temporal and positional information such as frame index and timestamp to ensure correct sequencing and detect reordering attacks. Layer 4: Authentication Layer (optional) digitally signs the embedded data using public-key cryptography to verify the source and prevent forgery. Together, these layers form a self-contained, secure, and verifiable media stream, capable of detecting tampering, ensuring data integrity, and functioning even in offline or low-resource environments. This approach is ideal for applications like secure video transmission, surveillance footage protection, and deepfake prevention.
