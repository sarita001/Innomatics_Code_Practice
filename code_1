The Informatica workflow generated the email user list using an updated SQL query on the sysuser table, including only Active users and excluding inactive ones, ensuring notifications were sent only to valid recipients.
	•	The CDI-PC cloudification update removed outdated INFA_HOME references, added the required truststore parameters, and updated reference paths in the parameter files, allowing the CDI-PC client to connect successfully to PROD and enabling all jobs to run without errors.
	•	The IMPACS update decommissioned the 33 S76 files and updated processing to handle only the 33 S71 files. The Autosys job FFW_IMPACS_ABCDET_EXTRACT ran recon and merge checks using the revised IMPACS_ABCDET_merge.sh script, which processed only S71 data and completed successfully without errors.











Updated all references and scripts to Python 3.11.11.
	•	Reconfigured OBIEE Cert Report to use the DR database.
	•	Adjusted DFR APAC Manual Statement Schedule timing for faster processing.
	•	Implemented Logic 69 change in DFR APAC Informatica for better SWIFT field matching.
	•	Fixed NBSP character issue in TRADS file by replacing nonblank characters.
	•	Updated APAC GIN archival path and schedule for parallel validation and new file implementation.
	•	Enhanced DR BAD Value Report to return only recent items.
	•	Applied Frontier configuration and scheduling updates for DR APAC Phase 2.























Informatica Workflow Update
The workflow now uses an enhanced SQL query on the sysuser table to generate email distribution lists. The updated logic ensures that only active users are included while inactive users are automatically excluded, resulting in accurate and up-to-date notification lists.

CDI-PC Cloudification Enhancements
As part of the cloudification upgrade, outdated INFA_HOME references have been removed from scripts and parameter files. Required truststore parameters have been added, and reference paths have been updated. These changes enable the CDI-PC client to authenticate with the PROD domains successfully, allowing all CDI-PC jobs to run without connectivity or configuration errors.

IMPACS Processing Update
The IMPACS module has been streamlined by decommissioning 33 legacy S76 files. Processing is now fully aligned to use only the remaining 33 S71 files. The Autosys job FFW_IMPACS_ABCDET_EXTRACT has been updated to run reconciliation and merge checks using the revised IMPACS_ABCDET_merge.sh script, which processes S71 data and completes without failures.
