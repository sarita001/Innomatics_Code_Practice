The CDI-PC update removes old INFA_HOME references, adds the required truststore parameters, and updates reference paths in the parameter files. These changes ensure the CDI-PC client connects to PROD domains successfully and all jobs run without errors.
The IMPACS update decommissions the 33 S76 files and updates processing to handle only the remaining 33 S71 files. The Autosys job FFW_IMPACS_ABCDET_EXTRACT now runs recon and merge checks using the revised IMPACS_ABCDET_merge.sh script, which processes S71 data only and completes successfully without errors.
