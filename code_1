Updating all existing script references and configurations to point to Python 3.11.11 as part of Phase 2 upgrade.

Modifying environment variables, job parameters, and Control-M scripts to ensure compatibility with the new Python version.

Reconfiguring OBIEE Cert Report connection strings to establish reporting from the DR database instead of production.

Adjusting DR APAC Manual Statement schedule timing in Control-M to align with upstream processing windows.

Implementing Logic 69 changes in DFR APAC Informatica to update the SWIFT file field for accurate matching.

Applying the NBSP character fix in the TRADS file by replacing nonbreaking spaces with empty spaces during file generation.

Updating APAC GIN archival path and schedule to support parallel validation and new file archival standards.

Enhancing the DR BAD Value Report logic to filter and display only recent items.

Applying Frontier configuration and scheduling updates as part of DR APAC Phase 2 deployment to ensure consistent job sequencing.































Objective

Upgrade all scripts and references to Python 3.11.11 under Phase 2 to ensure compatibility, stability, and compliance.

Reconfigure OBIEE Cert Report to connect to the DR database for improved resiliency.

Update DR APAC Manual Statement schedule timing as per upstream requirements.

Implement Logic 69 change, NBSP fix, and APAC GIN archival updates in DFR APAC Informatica.

Enhance DR BAD Value Report to retrieve only recent items.

Apply Frontier configuration and scheduling updates as part of DR APAC Phase 2 rollout.

Rationale

Ensures environment consistency and long-term support with Python 3.11.11 upgrade.

Improves disaster recovery readiness by directing OBIEE reporting to DR.

Optimizes batch processing efficiency by adjusting the APAC schedule timing.

Enhances data accuracy and integrity through Logic 69 and NBSP fixes.

Streamlines report performance by limiting output to relevant and recent records.

Aligns Frontier configurations with Phase 2 implementation standards.

Outcome

All applications and scripts execute successfully under Python 3.11.11.

OBIEE reports generate correctly from the DR environment.

APAC schedules run at revised timings with no dependency conflicts.

DFR APAC Informatica processes produce accurate and validated outputs.

BAD Value Report reflects only recent data, improving clarity and performance.

Frontier updates and configurations are successfully deployed and validated.

Overall system reliability, maintainability, and process efficiency are improved post-deployment.
