The present disclosure provides a method of watermarking digital media for subsequent decoding. The method includes receiving a secure content package comprising digital audiovisual content, source entity information, content annotations, and digital signatures. The package is validated using public-key cryptography. A content identifier is generated and embedded as a watermark into the digital audiovisual content. The watermark is configured to be machine readable and visually inconspicuous. A content databas entry is recorded in a remote database, retrievable using the content identifier and comprising the content annotations and sourc information. The watermarked digital audiovisual content is stored and transmitted to the media source. The method may further include generating and storing content hashes for future authentication comparisons.This change includes multiple Informatica enhancements and schedule adjustments to improve data quality, process automation, reporting, and compliance. It covers conversion of Python logic to Informatica for DFR CABL GIN files and CERT inactive user emails, correction of CERT alert timing to follow data loads, implementation of posting date-based duplicate checks in FED_CIB030, support for daily and holiday-based FIRD processing, rescheduling of FX rate load to the last calendar day, enrichment of GCO reports with record identifiers, updates to Frontier user statuses via APS, and vault password rotations for Informatica and Certification databases with A method of identifying deep fake content includes receiving content at a smart device; determining whether the content includes a hidden object therein; responsive the content including the hidden object, determining a hash in the hidden object; determining a local hash for the content by the smart device; and determining legitimacy of the content based on the hash in the hidden object and the local hash. The hidden object can be a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Token (JWT)At at be dies of tie dis as prie on, aimed meto is and ace for sea at ate any
algorithm is applied multiple times to a portion of secret data to embed it in a cover file. This constructs layers of hidden data, e.g secret data hidden in an image that is then used as secret data in a further cover file and so on. Each layer can incorporate encryption and authentication techniques to further enhance security. The final layer or a compressed version is provided within a blockchain transaction. Additionally or alternatively, the secret data can be split into a plurality of shares. This can be achieved using a splitting scheme such as, for example Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Different shares of the secret data can then be encrypted before being.






:
Implement multiple Informatica enhancements and schedule updates to improve data accuracy, process alignment, reporting quality, and compliance.

Rationale:
Align CERT alerts with load timing, convert Python logic to Informatica, prevent duplicate FED records, support daily FIRD files including holidays, update FX schedule, enrich GCO reports, automate inactive user notifications, correct Frontier user statuses, and complete required password rotations.

Outcome:
All changes deployed successfully. Alerts run post-load, Informatica outputs validated, duplicates eliminated, FIRD processed daily with bundling, FX loaded on correct date, GCO includes identifiers, user emails automated, statuses corrected, and credentials rotated with successful validation.



Impacted Area
The impacted areas include Informatica workflows, CERT staging tables and alerts, DFR CABL GIN file processing, FED_CIB030 logic, FIRD daily and holiday file handling, FX rate load schedule for BD5, GCO reporting, CERT inactive user notification, Frontier user status updates, and vault password configurations for Informatica and Certification databases.

Impacted Description
Python processes for DFR and CERT user notifications were migrated to Informatica. CERT alert timing was corrected to run post data load. FED_CIB030 logic was updated to prevent duplicates using posting date. FIRD processing was enhanced to handle daily files and bundle holiday ones. FX rate load was rescheduled to run on the last calendar day. GCO reports now include a record identifier for enrichment. APS was provided a procedure to update Frontier user statuses, and vault credentials were rotated for Informatica and Certification DBs with validations completed.

Dependent Area
Dependent areas include upstream data feeds to CERT and FED_CIB030 jobs, Frontier database tables, APS support processes, GCO downstream consumers, FX and FIRD file delivery from external systems, Informatica scheduling, vault secret management systems, and security group email configurations.

Dependent Description
CERT alert updates depend on timely completion of upstream data loads. FED_CIB030 changes rely on accurate posting date data from source files. Frontier user status updates require APS coordination. GCO report changes impact downstream systems consuming enriched reports. FX and FIRD processing rely on timely external file deliveries. Informatica job schedules must align with operational timing requirements. Vault password rotation depends on secret management tools and requires coordinated updates to all affected services. CERT user email notifications depend on accurate user group mappings and SMTP configurations.

Risk Description
There is a risk of CERT alerts misfiring due to delayed upstream loads, and data mismatches if Informatica conversions are not properly validated. FED duplicate logic may cause data duplication or loss if incorrectly applied. FIRD holiday handling may lead to missing or repeated files. FX schedule changes could impact BD5 processing. GCO report updates may break downstream dependencies. Vault password rotation without coordination may disrupt job connectivity. APS execution errors could update incorrect user statuses, and CERT email logic may fail due to SMTP misconfigurations.

Risk Mitigation Plan
All job dependencies and alert timings will be validated in lower environments. Informatica outputs will be verified through parallel runs. FED logic will be tested with varied posting dates. FIRD scenarios, including holidays, will be simulated in UAT. FX changes will be aligned with business expectations. GCO consumers will be notified in advance and provided with updated formats. Vault rotations will be scheduled with rollback steps in place. APS scripts will be tested before production use, and SMTP configurations will be validated with end-to-end email testing.
