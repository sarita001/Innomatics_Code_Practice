Technical Change Summary
The objective of this release is to deploy updates supporting the DFR LATAM go-live, enhance the certification process, and implement improvements in data retention and file transmissions.
•	Integrate Subaccount Rule into the daily file generation process to improve accuracy during pre-assignment.
•	Configure the OPTIM Lookup Table to retain loaded data for six months for audit and reference purposes.
•	Update DFR Recon transmission by routing the LA/CA file from Recon1 to Recon to align with the new reconciliation process.
•	Activate Informatica DFR LATAM jobs to support regional deployment.
•	Move scheduled jobs for LATAM and Canada from the inactive scheduler to Scheduler 74 as part of a dark deployment strategy.


Deployment Success / Exit Criteria
The deployment will be considered successful and complete when the following criteria are met:
•	Daily file generation includes the integrated Subaccount Rule logic and completes without errors.
•	OPTIM Lookup Table successfully retains data as per the updated 6-month retention configuration, verified via test load and retention check.
•	DFR LA/CA file transmission is successfully routed to the Recon location, with no failures in transmission or processing.
•	Informatica DFR LATAM jobs are activated and run successfully in the production environment, confirmed via job logs and monitoring.
•	LATAM and Canada scheduled jobs are moved to Scheduler 74 and verified as active, with no unintended job triggers or failures.
•	No critical or high-severity issues are reported within the monitoring period post-deployment.






Design Details
Steps taken to achieve the requirements:
•	Update the daily file generation logic to integrate the Subaccount Rule within the pre-assignment step, ensuring accurate rule application.
•	Modify the OPTIM Lookup Table configuration to enforce a 6-month data retention policy, validated through test data loads.
•	Change the DFR LA/CA file routing from Recon1 to Recon by updating job parameters and transmission paths to align with the new reconciliation flow.
•	Activate Informatica DFR LATAM jobs in production, ensuring all dependencies, parameters, and connections are correctly configured.
•	Move LATAM and Canada jobs from the inactive scheduler to Scheduler 74, maintaining a dark deployment mode (no active triggers) until go-live.
•	Perform validation through job monitoring, file output checks, and confirmation from stakeholders post-deployment.

Given the deployment is complete with all configurations in place (including Subaccount Rule integration, OPTIM retention setup, updated DFR file routing, Informatica LATAM job activation, and scheduler transition),
When the system processes scheduled jobs and related data flows as per the new design,
Then all components should function as expected—daily files should apply the Subaccount Rule, the OPTIM table should retain data for 6 months, LA/CA files should route to the correct destination, Informatica LATAM jobs should run without errors, and LATAM/Canada jobs should appear on Scheduler 74 in dark mode—with no critical issues observed post-deployment.

Objective
Deploy enhancements for DFR LATAM go-live, improve certification accuracy, optimize data retention, and update file transmission and job scheduling.

Rationale
Ensure compliance, improve data integrity, streamline reconciliation, and enable safe, controlled deployment.

Outcome
Accurate file processing, six-month data retention, correct file routing, error-free job execution, and seamless scheduler transition.


Impacted Area
•	Daily File Processing
•	OPTIM Lookup Table
•	DFR File Transmission
•	Informatica Jobs
•	Job Scheduler (Scheduler 74)
________________________________________
Impacted Description
•	Pre-assignment logic updated with Subaccount Rule.
•	Lookup table data retention set to six months.
•	LA/CA files rerouted from Recon1 to Recon.
•	LATAM Informatica jobs activated.
•	LATAM/Canada jobs moved to Scheduler 74.


Dependent Area
•	Source Data Systems
•	Network/File Transfer Infrastructure
•	Informatica ETL Platform
•	Job Monitoring and Alerting Tools
•	Scheduler 74 Environment
________________________________________
Dependent Description
•	Accurate and timely data input from source systems is essential for processing.
•	Reliable network and file transfer systems must support updated routing paths.
•	Informatica platform must be stable for LATAM job executions.
•	Monitoring tools must detect job failures or data issues promptly.
•	Scheduler 74 must be fully operational to handle migrated jobs.

Risk Description
•	Subaccount Rule integration may cause processing errors.
•	Data retention misconfiguration could lead to data loss.
•	File rerouting might cause transmission failures.
•	LATAM Informatica jobs risk configuration errors.
•	Scheduler 74 migration may cause job execution issues.
________________________________________
Risk Mitigation Plan
•	Test Subaccount Rule thoroughly before deployment.
•	Validate retention settings and monitor data post-deployment.
•	Test file routing and monitor transmissions.
•	Verify and test Informatica job configs.
•	Migrate scheduler during low-impact times and monitor jobs closely.
