Informatica Workflow Update
The workflow now uses an enhanced SQL query on the sysuser table to generate email distribution lists. The updated logic ensures that only active users are included while inactive users are automatically excluded, resulting in accurate and up-to-date notification lists.

CDI-PC Cloudification Enhancements
As part of the cloudification upgrade, outdated INFA_HOME references have been removed from scripts and parameter files. Required truststore parameters have been added, and reference paths have been updated. These changes enable the CDI-PC client to authenticate with the PROD domains successfully, allowing all CDI-PC jobs to run without connectivity or configuration errors.

IMPACS Processing Update
The IMPACS module has been streamlined by decommissioning 33 legacy S76 files. Processing is now fully aligned to use only the remaining 33 S71 files. The Autosys job FFW_IMPACS_ABCDET_EXTRACT has been updated to run reconciliation and merge checks using the revised IMPACS_ABCDET_merge.sh script, which processes S71 data and completes without failures.
