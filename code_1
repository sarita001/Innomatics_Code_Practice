To update Informatica workflows, CDI-PC configurations, and IMPACS processing logic to ensure accurate email notifications, compliant cloudification settings, and correct handling of S71 files after decommissioning the S76 file set.

Rationale

These changes are required to:

Restrict email notifications to Active users only, improving accuracy and reducing unnecessary communication.

Align CDI-PC configurations with updated cloudification standards, ensuring reliable connectivity and error-free job execution in PROD.

Remove dependency on the decommissioned S76 files and ensure IMPACS processing reflects the updated 33-file S71 structure.

Outcome

The workflows generate correct email lists, CDI-PC connects to PROD domains without errors, and IMPACS processing completes successfully using only S71 files. All jobs, scripts, and configurations function consistently post-deployment with no failures or unexpected behavior.


Impacted Area

Informatica workflows (Frontier Certification & IMPACS)

CDI-PC (Cloudification of PowerCenter Domains) configuration files

Autosys jobs and associated merge scripts

Parameter files


The email workflow now includes only Active users, improving notification accuracy. CDI-PC configuration updates modify truststore and environment parameter handling, impacting how the client connects to PROD domains. IMPACS processing changes remove S76 file handling and shift logic to S71-only processing, affecting recon and merge workflows. All updates enhance consistency and reduce processing errors across the Informatica and Autosys environments.



Dependent Area

Application Development Team

Informatica Administration Team

Autosys Scheduling Team

CDI-PC Support Team

Production Support / L3 Team



Application Development Team is dependent on these changes to ensure workflows execute with the correct SQL logic, updated parameters, and accurate file-processing rules.

Informatica Administration Team depends on the revised truststore and environment configurations to maintain stable and secure connectivity to the PROD domains.

Autosys Scheduling Team depends on the updated merge script and new S71-only logic to ensure scheduled jobs run successfully without expecting decommissioned S76 files.

CDI-PC Support Team relies on the updated configuration files to ensure the CDI-PC client connects properly to all PROD domains after cloudification updates.

Production Support / L3 Team depends on the correctness of these changes to prevent workflow failures, reduce incidents, and support smooth post-deployment operations.




Risk Description

Incorrect parameter updates or truststore configurations may cause CDI-PC connectivity failures in PROD domains.

Workflow dependencies may break if incorrect users are included or excluded in the updated email distribution logic.

IMPACS processing may fail if any S76 file unexpectedly arrives or if the merge script does not correctly handle S71-only logic.

Autosys jobs may encounter errors if updated script paths or file expectations are incorrect.

Any misconfiguration in .odbc.ini or autosys_jobmanrc.in may lead to job failures or environment instability.

Risk Mitigation Plan

Perform pre-deployment validation of all parameter files, truststore paths, and configuration updates.

Validate the updated SQL query in lower environments to ensure only Active users are included in the email list.

Conduct controlled testing of IMPACS S71-only processing and ensure the merge script handles the updated logic accurately.

Monitor Autosys jobs during the initial execution window post-deployment to detect any missed references or file mismatches.

Maintain a rollback plan with backups of all original configuration files to restore the previous state if required.

Keep all support teams (Informatica Admin, Autosys, CDI-PC Support, Production Support) on standby during the deployment window for quick issue resolution.
