The deployment includes the ARC switchback for Frontier Finance along with Frontier BAU items covering DFR enhancements, FIRD Recon transmissions and reporting view, SEPA import format, OBIEE view updates, and IIS password reset. All validations are complete and systems are running smoothly in production.

To conduct the ARC exercise for the Frontier Finance application by switching from the Production environment to the Frontier Disaster Recovery (DR) contingency environment. During this period, Production will be brought offline and the application will operate on contingency servers for 5 days until business validation is complete. After successful completion, the application will be switched back to the Production environment, thereby completing the ARC exercise.









GIVEN the ARC failover activity for the Frontier Finance application,
WHEN Production services are brought down and the application is switched over to the Disaster Recovery (DR) environment,
THEN users should be able to log in successfully to the DR environment, and business sign-off will be provided upon completion of the failover activity.











DFR APAC updates deployed to support regional go-live.
	•	Certification process enhanced for improved efficiency.
	•	Subaccount Rule integrated into daily file generation for accurate pre-assignment.
	•	Data retention and file transmission improvements implemented.
	•	Informatica DFR APAC jobs and batch processes successfully 	•	GIVEN the ARC failover exercise scheduled in September,
	•	WHEN the application is switched from Production to the Disaster Recovery (DR) contingency environment and the Production system is brought offline,
	•	THEN the application will run on contingency servers until business validations are successfully completed, after which it will be switched back to Production.















Added RSS mailbox for Certification scheduler failure notifications.
	•	Migrated maintenance deadline emails from Frontier to Informatica.
	•	Implemented MFTD, BIFOUT, and CABLEIN processes in Informatica with parallel runs.
	•	Created new Frontier company with accounts, jobs, and match passes.
	•	Enabled user notifications upon Frontier import completion.
	•	Integrated TRADS, SWIFT, and GBS files into APAC Recon.
	•	Updated logic to construct GIN references and include write-offs in matched groups.
	•	Built Informatica table for Federal Reserve code descriptions.
	•	Implemented Fed feed bundling for weekends/holidays and adjusted LIQ schedule for Christmas/New Year.
	•	Created security groups for reporting access and a view for TEBS balance reporting.
Implement DFR APAC enhancements in Informatica, Frontier, and OBIEE to automate access, streamline feed processing, and improve reconciliation and notifications in UAT and Production.

Rationale

These updates reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and enhance user experience. Automated OBIEE access ensures secure provisioning, reliable file processing supports financial integrity, and notifications give users visibility into reconciliation status.

Outcome

OBIEE provisions access for DFR APAC users via AD groups after scheduled batch runs.

GBS, TRADS, and SWIFT files are processed in Informatica, imported into Frontier NAS, and reconciled in DFR APAC.

Informatica processes IMSJ/P/M feeds and transmits outputs to NASPATH RECON without errors.

Users receive automated emails when the DFR APAC match process starts and completes.


Risk Description

Deployment of DFR APAC changes in Informatica, Frontier, and OBIEE may cause risks such as incorrect OBIEE access via AD groups, failures in processing GBS/TRADS/SWIFT/IMSJ-P-M feeds, missed Frontier notifications, or system instability, leading to access issues, data gaps, or reconciliation delays.

Risk Mitigation Plan

Validate AD groups and OBIEE access in UAT, cross-check Informatica outputs with Python, enable job/notification monitoring, retain backup files for reprocessing, communicate timelines to users, provide hypercare support, and keep rollback plans ready for quick recovery.
