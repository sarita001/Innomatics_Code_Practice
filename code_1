Given the Phase 2 implementation involves updates to Python, OBIEE, Informatica, and scheduling components, when all planned changes — including the Python 3.11.11 upgrade, OBIEE DR configuration, schedule adjustment, Logic 69 enhancement, NBSP fix, APAC GIN archival update, BAD Value Report improvement, and Frontier configuration update — are deployed, then all impacted processes should execute successfully without errors, deliver accurate validated outputs, align with the revised schedules, ensure seamless OBIEE reporting from the DR environment, and demonstrate end-to-end stability through successful functional and regression testing.





























Objective

Upgrade all scripts and references to Python 3.11.11 under Phase 2 to ensure compatibility, stability, and compliance.

Reconfigure OBIEE Cert Report to connect to the DR database for improved resiliency.

Update DR APAC Manual Statement schedule timing as per upstream requirements.

Implement Logic 69 change, NBSP fix, and APAC GIN archival updates in DFR APAC Informatica.

Enhance DR BAD Value Report to retrieve only recent items.

Apply Frontier configuration and scheduling updates as part of DR APAC Phase 2 rollout.

Rationale

Ensures environment consistency and long-term support with Python 3.11.11 upgrade.

Improves disaster recovery readiness by directing OBIEE reporting to DR.

Optimizes batch processing efficiency by adjusting the APAC schedule timing.

Enhances data accuracy and integrity through Logic 69 and NBSP fixes.

Streamlines report performance by limiting output to relevant and recent records.

Aligns Frontier configurations with Phase 2 implementation standards.

Outcome

All applications and scripts execute successfully under Python 3.11.11.

OBIEE reports generate correctly from the DR environment.

APAC schedules run at revised timings with no dependency conflicts.

DFR APAC Informatica processes produce accurate and validated outputs.

BAD Value Report reflects only recent data, improving clarity and performance.

Frontier updates and configurations are successfully deployed and validated.

Overall system reliability, maintainability, and process efficiency are improved post-deployment.
