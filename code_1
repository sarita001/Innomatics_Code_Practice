Dependency Category: Technology

Dependent Area
The dependent areas are Frontier, Informatica, and Feeds/Reporting.

Dependent Description
The Frontier dependency lies in existing notification and company setup capabilities. Enhancements depend on Frontierâ€™s ability to add recipients for certification scheduler alerts, create new companies with accounts and jobs, and notify users when imports are complete. In Informatica, dependencies include job scheduling and workflow execution to handle the migration of maintenance emails from Frontier, implementation of new processes (MFTD, BIFOUT, CABLEIN) in parallel runs, and logic updates for GIN reference construction, write-off handling, and Federal Reserve code table integration. For Feeds/Reporting, dependencies include the availability and integration of external file feeds (TRADS, SWIFT, GBS, Fed, and LIQ) into APAC Recon, as well as reporting infrastructure for creating security groups and enabling new views to access TEBS balances.

Impacted Area
The impacted areas are Frontier, Informatica, and Feeds/Reporting.

Impacted Description
In Frontier, impact includes adding RSS mailbox recipients for scheduler failure alerts, creating a new company with accounts and jobs, and notifying users once imports complete. In Informatica, maintenance emails are migrated from Frontier, new processes (MFTD, BIFOUT, CABLEIN) are implemented with parallel runs, and logic updates improve GIN reference construction, write-off handling, and Federal Reserve reporting support. In Feeds/Reporting, TRADS, SWIFT, and GBS files are added to APAC Recon, Fed and LIQ feeds are bundled to handle weekends and holidays, security groups are introduced for access control, and a new view enables TEBS balance reporting.
