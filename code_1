Objective
Streamline global financial data processing by migrating key Frontier processes to Informatica, enhancing automation, and improving reporting and notification workflows.

Rationale
Ensure timely, accurate, and complete data processing across regions by reducing manual steps, handling holiday/weekend feeds, and expanding reporting access.

Outcome
Critical processes (MFTD, BIFOUT, CABLEIN) running in parallel on Informatica, updated notifications with RSS mailbox, new Frontier company setup, full TRADS/SWIFT/GBS integration for APAC recon, accurate GIN reference logic, inclusion of write-offs, automated holiday/weekend bundling for Fed/LIQ files, and enhanced reporting through new tables, views, and security groups.

Impacted Area
Changes affect Frontier, Informatica, file feed scheduling, and reporting. Frontier updates include new company setup, enhanced reconciliation, corrected GIN logic, and inclusion of write-offs. Informatica covers migration and parallel runs of MFTD, BIFOUT, and CABLEIN, plus creation of a Federal Reserve code table. Scheduling changes add automated Fed and LIQ bundling for weekends/holidays. Reporting improvements include a TEBS balance view and security groups for controlled access.

Impacted Description
Enhancements expand Frontier capabilities, improve reconciliation accuracy, and ensure complete data feeds. Informatica migration boosts automation and global process consistency. Automated bundling prevents weekend/holiday data loss, while reporting and access updates improve availability, security, and quality of information for users.

Dependent Area
Frontier processing, Informatica workflows, reconciliation processes, reporting systems, and scheduling modules.

Dependent Description
Frontier relies on new company setup, updated logic, and integrated file inputs to process data accurately. Informatica workflows depend on migrated and tested regional processes to ensure consistent global operation. Reconciliation accuracy depends on timely availability of complete file feeds. Reporting systems depend on the new tables, views, and security groups to deliver accurate and secure data access. Scheduling modules depend on updated bundling jobs to handle weekend/holiday processing without data loss.

Risk Description
Migration of critical processes (MFTD, BIFOUT, CABLEIN) to Informatica and updates to Frontier logic may cause processing errors, reconciliation mismatches, or missed file feeds if configurations or schedules are incorrect. Automated bundling changes carry the risk of incomplete or duplicate data during weekends/holidays. Reporting enhancements may face access issues if security groups or views are misconfigured.

Risk Mitigation Plan
Run extended parallel testing for all migrated processes to validate outputs against existing production results. Validate bundling jobs across multiple weekend/holiday scenarios before go-live. Implement step-by-step configuration reviews, peer testing, and scheduler validation to avoid missed or duplicate files. Perform controlled rollout of reporting changes with user acceptance testing to confirm correct access and data accuracy. Maintain rollback plans for each process to revert quickly if errors occur.
