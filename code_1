Current Process Overheads

Repetitive back-and-forth with users for simple data errors.

Manual validations in Python for issues that could be preemptively caught in Excel.

Validation Optimization

Shift basic validations (e.g., empty cells, format checks) to Excel macros.

Retain advanced validations (requiring database access) in Python scripts.

➤ Benefit: Faster turnaround time and reduced dependency on tech team.

Dynamic Updates via API

Exploring the use of the Frontier API for item updates.

If viable, implement an Excel plugin/macro with a “Submit” button that:

Pushes updates instantly via API.

Captures audit logs for traceability.

Eliminates the need for batch scheduling.

User Template Standardization

Proposal to roll out a standardized Excel template across users with:

Predefined structure

Embedded macros for validations

Access Ownership

Only our team (Team 33) is authorized to make changes to common views in Frontier.

FieldTable is a sensitive component requiring restricted modifications.

Upcoming Developments

A new version of Frontier is expected to be available in dev within 10–15 days, post which testing can be initiated.
