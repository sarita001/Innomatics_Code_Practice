• ARC Exercise – Informatica DR Switch
Switching to DR environment to run production processing for a week, ensuring disaster recovery readiness.
• CERT Staging Table Alert Update
Rescheduling the alert job to run after AA load to ensure accurate and timely validation.
• DFR CABL GIN File Parallel Validation
Rebuilding CABL GIN file logic in Informatica and validating outputs against existing Python files.
• FED_CIB030 Duplicate Check
Implementing posting date-based deduplication to prevent duplicate FED record loads.
• FIRD 7-Day Processing
Updating schedule to process FIRD files daily, in line with Federal Reserve’s 7-day delivery.
• FX Rate Load Schedule Update
Changing FX rate load to run on last calendar day instead of last business day for BD5 accuracy.
• GCO Report Updates
Adding record identifier to GCO report to support downstream enrichment and tracking.
• Inactive CERT User Email Automation
Migrating email alert logic for inactive users from Python to Informatica for automation.
• Closed User Table Update Procedure
Creating ad-hoc process to allow APS to update SysUser status in Frontier securely.
• Vault Password Rotation
Rotating DB credentials as per RISE intake and validating Informatica job connectivity.




Given the set of updates across Informatica workflows, schedules, and system integrations,
When the changes are implemented as per the design specifications,
Then
	• DR processing should run successfully for one week without failures, validating disaster recovery readiness.
	• CERT alert job should trigger only after AA load completion, ensuring accurate validation.
	• Informatica-generated CABL GIN files should match Python outputs exactly, confirming logic parity.
	• FED_CIB030 duplicate records based on posting date should be excluded from the final load.
	• FIRD files should be processed daily, including weekends/holidays, with correct bundling logic.
	• FX rate load should execute on the last calendar day, reflecting accurate data in downstream reports.
	• GCO report should include a record identifier and pass enrichment validations.
	• Inactive CERT user emails should be sent via Informatica with correct user identification.
	• APS should be able to update SysUser status using the ad-hoc process, with successful audit logging.
	• Vault password updates should not impact job execution; all connections must remain valid post-change.
	
	
	
	
Technical Change Summary
	• Switch production processing to the Informatica Disaster Recovery environment for one week to validate DR readiness.
	• Reschedule the CERT alert job to run after AA load for proper validation sequencing.
	• Rebuild CABL GIN file logic in Informatica and validate it against Python output in parallel.
	• Implement posting date–based duplicate filtering in FED_CIB030 load process.
	• Enable daily (7-day) FIRD file processing, including logic for handling holiday file bundling.
	• Update FX rate load to run on the last calendar day of the month instead of the last business day.
	• Add a unique record identifier to the GCO report to support data enrichment and traceability.
	• Convert inactive CERT user email logic from Python to Informatica for automated notifications.
	• Develop an ad-hoc Informatica utility for APS to update SysUser statuses in Frontier.
	• Rotate Vault passwords for Informatica and Certification DBs as part of RISE intake 1761.


Deployment Success / Exit Criteria
	• DR environment processes production workflows for 7 consecutive days without errors or missed SLAs.
	• CERT alert job consistently triggers after AA load completion with no timing conflicts.
	• Informatica-generated CABL GIN files match Python outputs exactly in content and structure.
	• FED_CIB030 duplicate records based on posting date are successfully filtered out during load.
	• FIRD files are processed correctly each day, including weekends and holidays, with accurate bundling.
	• FX rate load job runs on the last calendar day and reflects correct data in downstream outputs.
	• GCO report includes the new record identifier, and all enrichment validations pass.
	• Email notifications for inactive CERT users are triggered correctly via Informatica logic.
	• APS successfully executes the ad-hoc SysUser update process with changes reflected in Frontier.
	• All Informatica and Certification DB jobs run successfully post Vault password rotation.
